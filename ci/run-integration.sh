# Run this repo's sqllogictest suite (test/sql/*.test) against the vgi-x509
# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source. See ci/README.md.
#
# The x509 worker inspects TLS endpoints, so the suite needs a TLS server:
# this script builds the repo's `mockserver`, starts it on a free port, and
# points tls_inspect at 127.0.0.1:<port> via VGI_X509_TEST_ADDR (a host:port,
# NOT a URL — mirroring `make test-sql`).
#
# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST   path to the haybarn-unittest binary
#   VGI_X509_WORKER    worker LOCATION the .test files ATTACH (the built Go
#                      worker binary the vgi extension spawns over stdio)
# Optional:
#   STAGE              scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)

# --- Start the mock TLS server (the .test files inspect it) -----------------

# prints "PORT:<n>" on stdout (see cmd/mockserver/main.go). We capture that,
# export VGI_X509_TEST_ADDR (host:port), and kill the server on exit —
# exactly like `make test-sql`.
