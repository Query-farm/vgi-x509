# Run this repo's sqllogictest suite (test/sql/*.test) against the vgi-x509
# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source. See ci/README.md.
#
# Multi-transport: the same suite runs over whichever transport the TRANSPORT
# env var selects, by changing what `VGI_X509_WORKER` resolves to (the vgi
# extension picks the transport from the ATTACH LOCATION string):
#
#   subprocess (default)  VGI_X509_WORKER = the stdio worker binary
#                         -> extension spawns it over stdin/stdout.
#   http                  start `<worker> --http` (prints "PORT:<n>"), parse the
#                         port, VGI_X509_WORKER = http://127.0.0.1:<port>.
#   unix                  start `<worker> --unix /tmp/x509.sock` (prints
#                         "UNIX:<path>"), VGI_X509_WORKER = unix:///tmp/x509.sock.
#
# In every transport the x509 worker's tls_inspect connects to a TLS endpoint,
# so the suite ALWAYS needs the mock TLS server: this script builds the repo's
# `mockserver`, starts it on a free port, and points tls_inspect at
# 127.0.0.1:<port> via VGI_X509_TEST_ADDR (a host:port, NOT a URL). All started
# processes are trap-killed on exit.
#
# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST   path to the haybarn-unittest binary
#   VGI_X509_WORKER    for TRANSPORT=subprocess: the worker LOCATION the .test
#                      files ATTACH (the built Go worker binary, spawned over
#                      stdio). For http/unix this is OVERRIDDEN by this script,
#                      but the binary it points at is reused to launch the
#                      out-of-band server, so it must still be the worker path.
# Optional:
#   TRANSPORT          subprocess (default) | http | unix
#   STAGE              scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)
